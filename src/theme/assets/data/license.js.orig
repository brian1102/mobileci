		<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>B.
			<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</span>CONTRACTOR is an independent provider of delivery services, authorized to conduct the delivery services contemplated

			by this Agreement in accordance with all applicable laws. CONTRACTOR desires to enter into this Agreement for the right
			to access the Platform to receive delivery opportunities made available through the Platform. CONTRACTOR understands and
			expressly agrees that he/she is not an employee of YOJEE or any consumer or business client. CONTRACTOR understands he/she
			is free to select those times he/she wishes to be available on the Platform to receive delivery opportunities and to select
			those only those deliveries he/she wishes to select.</p>

		<p class=MsoNormal>In consideration of the above recitals and the mutual promises below, and for other good and valuable consideration, YOJEE
			and CONTRACTOR (collectively "the Parties") agree as follows:</p>

			<b>Purpose Of Agreement</b>
		</p>

		<p class=MsoNormal>This Agreement governs the relationship between YOJEE and CONTRACTOR, and establishes the Parties" respective rights and
			obligations applicable to the "Delivery Opportunities" (defined in Section 3.A below) made available to CONTRACTOR through
			the Platform. In exchange for the promises contained in this Agreement, CONTRACTOR shall have the contractual right and
			obligation to perform those Delivery Opportunities that CONTRACTOR accepts ("Deliveries"). However, nothing in this Agreement
			requires CONTRACTOR to perform any particular Delivery or volume of Deliveries during the term of this Agreement (except
			as expressly stated in Section 11, "Term and Termination," below), and nothing in this Agreement shall guarantee CONTRACTOR
			any particular volume of Delivery Opportunities or Deliveries for any particular time period.</p>

		<p class=MsoNormal>As described in "Deliveries," (defined in Section 3.A below), CONTRACTOR shall be contractually bound to complete the Deliveries
			in accordance with all consumer and restaurant/merchant specifications.</p>

			</span>CONTRACTOR represents that he/she is an independent provider of delivery services, and that he/she satisfies all

			shall be solely responsible for determining how to lawfully perform Deliveries.
		</p>

		<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>B.
			<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</span>CONTRACTOR agrees to fully perform all Deliveries accepted in a timely, efficient, safe and lawful manner. YOJEE
			shall have no right to, and shall not, supervise, direct or control CONTRACTOR, or control the manner or prescribe the
			method CONTRACTOR uses to perform Deliveries, and the general public and all governmental agencies regulating the activities
			contemplated by this Agreement shall be so informed. CONTRACTOR shall be solely responsible for determining the most effective,
			efficient, satisfactory and safe manner to perform Deliveries, including determining the manner of pickup, delivery, and
			route selection. The Parties acknowledge and agree that those provisions of the Agreement reserving ultimate authority
			in YOJEE have been inserted solely to achieve compliance with local laws, regulations, and interpretations thereof and/or
			to ensure the safety of the Platform for all users.</p>

			neither has nor reserves the right to restrict CONTRACTOR from performing delivery services for other entities or customers,
			or consumers, at any time, even should such business directly compete with YOJEE. Unless prohibited by law, and provided
			CONTRACTOR can meet the consumer"s specifications, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit CONTRACTOR from carrying and/or
			delivering goods at the same time for other of CONTRACTOR"s customers while delivering orders requested by consumers through
			the YOJEE platform. Similarly, to the extent CONTRACTOR uses other online platforms to generate revenue, CONTRACTOR is
			not limited in any way from being actively logged on to those other online platforms while actively logged on to the YOJEE
			platform, subject only to the limitation that CONTRACTOR"s use of other online platforms may not prevent CONTRACTOR"s

			</span>While CONTRACTOR is actively logged on to the Platform, the Platform will, from time to time, notify CONTRACTOR
			of the opportunity to complete deliveries from consumers and business clients (each, a "Delivery Opportunity"). With respect
			to each Delivery Opportunity accepted by CONTRACTOR (a "Delivery"), CONTRACTOR agrees to retrieve the orders from corporate
			and/or retail locations, (collectively "Merchants") and deliver the order to consumers in a timely fashion. CONTRACTOR
			understands that the consumer, not YOJEE, determines the Delivery. CONTRACTOR understands that YOJEE shall have no right
			to, and shall not, supervise, direct or control the manner or prescribe the method CONTRACTOR uses to perform the Delivery.
			CONTRACTOR understands and agrees that the parameters of each Delivery are established by the consumer, not YOJEE, and
			represent the end result desired, not the means by which CONTRACTOR is to accomplish the end result.</p>

		<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>B.

		<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'>C.
			<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</span>CONTRACTOR authorizes YOJEE, during the course of a Delivery, to communicate with CONTRACTOR, consumer and/or Merchants

			shall YOJEE be authorized to control the manner or means by which CONTRACTOR performs a Delivery.</p>

			that Delivery (in direct proportion to the degree of CONTRACTOR"s responsibility for the Service Failure). If CONTRACTOR

			understands that delivery fees paid through the Platform may vary depending on consumer demand. YOJEE may, but is not
